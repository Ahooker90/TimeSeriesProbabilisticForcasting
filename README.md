# TimeSeriesProbabilisticForcasting

The aim of this project is to build a strong foundation in the field of cutting-edge time series forecasting, both as a means of advancing our educational understanding and serving as an invaluable learning experience. Furthermore, our team is dedicated to incorporating uncertainty estimates in our predictive models, a step we believe is crucial for practical applications and their acceptance in business environments. While our aspirations are largely rooted in pedagogical purposes, they are motivated by a strong desire to eventually contribute to the research community that has sparked our interest in the real-world implications of machine learning.

We would also like to recognize the significant contributions of Niels Rogge and Kashif Rasul for their clear and concise introduction to "Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting with Transformers". This served as an accessible introduction to the field and was used as a reference design for this project.
